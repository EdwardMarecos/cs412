                Hi! My name is Edward Marecos, I was born in Livingston NJ but grew up in Kearny and Newark NJ.
                At Boston Uni I'm studying Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration and Managment.
                Other than this class I am taking a class about the Renissance, health, and android app development.

                                I recently took up bouldering as a hobby over the summer with 
                                some of my friends. If curious, you could catch me falling at

                                I played ice hockey during highschool, and in college I found a more peaceful
                                alternative and took up skating. I highly reccomend trying it, the feeling of 
                                going super fast on the ice is unmatched!

                                I really enjoy traveling, over last spring break I took a trip to Iceland with
                                my friend. We stayed in a camper van and drove around the country! Traveling really 
                                puts into perspective how much there is to see, learn, and do!
